# UtilityColumns
This mod adds new utility-based columns to RimWorld. These have a wide range of effects, from merging simple objects like the Orbital Trade Beacon with a column, to implementing more advanced custom columns like the Cluster Column.

## Installation
1. Download the mod and extract it.
2. Copy the `UtilityColumns` folder into your RimWorld `Mods` directory.
3. Enable **Utility Columns** from the in-game mod menu and restart the game.

## Compatibility
- **Supported RimWorld versions:** 1.2, 1.3, 1.4 and 1.5.
- Requires the Harmony library (bundled with the mod).
- Some column types use features from the **Royalty** or **Anomaly** expansions but the base mod will run without them. When an expansion is missing those columns are simply disabled.

## Column overview
- **Light Column** – basic column that lights a room.
- **Crystal Column** – luxurious variant of the light column.
- **Orbital Trade Column** – functions as a trade beacon and provides light.
- **Sun Column** – acts like a large sun lamp and gently warms the area, ideal for greenhouses.
- **Frozen Column** – serves as a cooler to keep rooms chilled.
- **Cluster Column** – detects enemies and fires explosive charges for defense.
- **Flame Column** – defensive column that launches incendiary bombs.
- **Stun Pulse Column** – emits a strong EMP/stun pulse to disable attackers.
- **Deadlife Column** – raises nearby corpses to fight for you *(requires Anomaly DLC)*.
- **Grave Column** – ornamental burial column for honored dead.
- **Archotech Drone Column** – consumes plasteel to repair or restore equipment.

All columns support roofs so removing one may cause collapse. Only install what you need and keep an eye on power requirements!
